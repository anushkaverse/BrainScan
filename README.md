# Brain Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project uses a deep learning model to detect brain diseases such as
brain tumors and Alzheimer's disease from MRI scans.

## Features
- Multi-class brain disease classification
- Pre-trained CNN-based model
- MRI image inference using Python

## Dataset
Public MRI datasets (e.g., BraTS / Kaggle) were used for training.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open the notebook:
   notebooks/testing_brainscan.ipynb
3. Load the trained model and test MRI images

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
